# Mitigation Strategy for A01: Broken Access Control

To mitigate Broken Access Control:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce that users can only access resources based on their authenticated roles.
- Validate user permissions on both the server-side and client-side.
- Use secure session management to prevent tampering (e.g., encrypt session cookies).
- Regularly audit access logs and use tools like OWASP ZAP for testing.
